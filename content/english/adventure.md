            <p>Come and experience off-roading on our BMW bikes at our exclusive Central Park.</p>
            <p>Each 90-minute session on one of our off-road GSs will involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motorcycle recovery - how to pick up a bike</li>
                <li>Bike handling</li>
                <li>Slow control</li>
                <li>Basics of off-road riding</li>
                <li>Riding an off-road trail</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each session includes the use of our off-road prepared GS motorcycles.</p>
            <p>You must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a full motorcycle licence and bring it with you (both parts if it is a two-part licence);</li>
                <li>Provide your own motorcycle equipment - helmet, clothing and boots (boots must have adequate ankle and
                    shin protection);</li>
                <li>Register with us, on-site, at least 15 minutes prior to the start of your chosen session.</li>
                <li>The most important area of off-road clothing is boots. Adequate ankle, foot and shin protection for
                    off-road riding are very important to avoid serious injury in these areas. We cannot recommend highly
                    enough that all participants wear an off-road boot that provides good protection and rigidity around the
                    foot, ankle and shin to reduce the risk of injury.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ankle boots/sneakers/shoes/trainers are not acceptable as footwear and participation will be refused.</p>
