We had a great time – it was just too short.

Renting the bikes & having the route plugged into the sat Nav worked very well so we could relax & enjoy the riding without the hassle of too much map-reading.

Bikes were excellent & we had complete confidence in their handling & balance in some very wet weather.

We’ll definitely be back again. Many thanks to Amy, Martin & your team.
