One of the best indicators of a great trip is if you think it went by too fast and you wanted to keep on going… That is how we felt about the 8 day motorcycle trip you set up for all of us.

The entire ride throughout Scotland was seamless and smooth. It meant a lot to us to help support small hotel and restaurant owners, and the places you set up for us were memorable. We took every small side trip and way point and added a couple of our own such as Neist Point.

Biggest surprises for us were weather (sunshine!), topography (mountains), water (everywhere) roads (single track), food (amazing) and people (super friendly). Scotland is one of the cleanest, friendliest and most beautiful countries we have been to.

We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend your company to other like minded travellers.

Thanks again to your entire staff for all your help.
