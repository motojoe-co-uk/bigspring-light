We can’t thank you enough for the work you and the boys did to make our trip so wonderful. 

Everything went off without a hitch, the routing was perfect, and the accommodations were right in line with our expectations. 

We spent a good deal of time talking with Joe upon our return (what a great guy!) and he tried to get us to complain about something – anything! – but to no avail.

Thanks again for putting together such a wonderful holiday for us.
