Big thank you to you and Joe!

We had a great trip and appreciated the professional service and hospitality received.  
You have a great team together at your store and all went very smooth from day one until departure.  
The hotels and restaurants were great, especially the Castle at Harris which was the icing on the cake.

Weather was at times bit wet and windy but we were well equipped for this enjoying the beauty of the Scottish landscape.  
The routes were great as not one day was the same and I think the timing was perfect as the roads were empty.

You guys also took care of us when we had the problem with one of the bikes and this is what makes a big difference between service providers.

We hope to be back one day and certainly will speak highly of you to all our friends and recommend you to fellow motorists.

This was my third time in Scotland and IÂ´ll be back.

Best Regards to all of you,

Erkan
