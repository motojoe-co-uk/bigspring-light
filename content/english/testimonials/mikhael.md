Among the options offered to me by rentamotorcycle, I chose a pre-planned personal trip.

The entire route was ready made in the navigator, the hotels were pre-ordered and all that was left was just to ride in the majestic views of Scotland.

The trip was mostly on magical side roads and minimum of highways.

The hotels were hospitable and welcoming, and in some of them the dinner was really excellent.

The crew of rentamotorcycle: Martin, Tony and Amy have done above and beyond to support me with any question or request and make the trip as pleasant as it can be.

For those of us motorcyclists who like individual trips I warmly recommend this trip.
