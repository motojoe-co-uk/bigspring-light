Thank you very much for organising the tour.

We were very happy about tour planning and especially to the carefully planned routes you had put to the GPS.

The best part is always to be able to ride on small roads in the countryside and we indeed visited many of them.  
  
The choices for our accommodation were also excellent.

It was also very thoughtful of you to send regular updates on the ferry connections.

I’m sure we’ll return some day to Scotland and will be in touch then.
