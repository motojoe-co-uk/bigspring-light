The trip was absolutely fantastic. 

The R1200GS worked great — no issues. The team at the dealership were fantastic and very accommodating. The route and accommodations were spectacular. The weather even cooperated — no rain until the day after I returned the bike. 

My only disappointment was the trip was too short — my scheduling difficulties, not anything you could have done.

I will post a couple of pictures from the trip to your facebook page and I am already trying to plan another trip for September 2019 — for at least 7-9 days rather than just 3.

Thanks again for a wonderful trip!
