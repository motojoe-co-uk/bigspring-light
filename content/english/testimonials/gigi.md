A big thank you to you and the team of rentamotorcycle.co.uk! We had an incredible long weekend in Scotland with friends and you and the great customer service you provide contributed to it a lot.

I had done quite some research where to rent what bike since we would have our own motorcycles and friends coming in by boat from The Netherlands and me flying into Edinburgh renting a bike for me for the 1st day and for a 2nd person for the other days.

Your website is extremely clear and helps a lot in the choice of bikes. Since we are all BMW fan’s, your choice of excellent bikes made it even better. The joy was even bigger after I called you guys getting Amy on the phone. You basically took all the questions away and guided us through the process how to do the booking with multiple drivers and it all felt very reliable, I was an instant fan of Amy! The fact that you are in the same group with the Edinburgh BMW Motorrad dealership is an excellent combination.

Everything you promised was exceeded. For good reasons you could not give us the chosen rented bike, so you gave us the choice of upgraded alternative bikes. I came an hour earlier than expected (even before official opening hours), but your were there and prepared. The reception was very friendly, the paperwork very fast, the bike brand new and the explanation very helpful. I even learned a few things about the GS that I even did not know after owning one for multiple years!

The trip has been truly amazing, the R 1250 GS being a fabulous companion in the Scottish Highlands. The fact that you supply the bike with the original panniers makes luggage no problem. And I even received a tire puncture repair set just in case, which we, fortunately, did not need.  
When I returned the bike on Sunday you were flexible enough to return the bike 2 hours earlier than we agreed and Kenny was even kind enough to arrange transportation for me to the airport. All and all a complete and worry-free rental of a fantastic bike!

Renting a motorcycle is not cheap, but at Rentamotorcycle.co.uk it’s worth every penny!

See you next time!
