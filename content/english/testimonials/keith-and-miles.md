Thanks for arranging the trip for us. We had a fantastic time.   
  
The route and hotels were excellent. We especially enjoyed Tongue and Sheildaig. I’m sure we’ll be back.  
  
All the best,  
Keith

I concur, the trip was extraordinary. The route was perfect. It took us to the furthest corners of Scotland and beyond. The accommodation was cosy and welcoming.   
  
The bikes were perfect and the team in Edinburgh were very helpful.  
  
You really did us proud. Thanks for all your help.  
  
We shall **DEFINITELY** return.
