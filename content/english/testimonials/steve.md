Well what can I say, a fantastic trip, well organised, fantastic route which gave us everything, the most amazing sights, some challenges and a great experience of Scotland which for us was made even better by the ever changing weather.

Everyone at Motorrad Central were really welcoming and helpful particularly Greg who met us and saw us off on Friday.
