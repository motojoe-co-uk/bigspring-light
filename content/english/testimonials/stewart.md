Thanks!

Our Highland Bike Road Trip 2017 had a miserable start to the weekend on Saturday weather wise but a spirited run between Banchory, Ballater and Braemar to the Spittal of Glenshee and on to Pitlochry.

On Sunday the sun has shone bright and we made up for it in spades ðŸ˜Ž

Will defo use you guys again for another ride out. If you could please pass my gratitude onto the Edinburgh site for their impeccable service as always.

Always a pleasure!

Til the next time!

All the best
