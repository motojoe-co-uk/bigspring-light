Weâ€™re back home and settled after our wonderful trip to Scotland. Thanks for all the great arrangements.

We followed the predesigned route with a few small exceptions â€“ our first dayâ€™s departure was delayed as I rode to Dalkeith and back to recover a couple of small items I had left in a bag we had intended to take but had had to leave behind. Also a minor detour to a shopping mall to obtain a prepaid SIM card proved both fruitless and time-consuming, meaning that by the time we reached Aberfeldy we were 3-4 hours off our intended schedule and it was so late we decided to blast up the A9 in order to make it to dinner at Grantown-On-Spey.  
On our last day of riding, when leaving Inveraray we decided not to retrace our route back to Oban and over, as the tour plan suggested, and instead took the A83 East and then A82 north to join the tour route.

A836 up to Tongue deserves a special mention, as well as the coastal road to Applecross. Sadly, the Bealach Na Ba crossing was immersed in clouds, with 10-yard visibility. I guess weâ€™ll have to come check it out another time ðŸ™‚

In conclusion, we had an amazing trip! Big thanks to you and the Motorrad Central team for a fine bike and a great tour, weâ€™ll be sure to spread the word!
