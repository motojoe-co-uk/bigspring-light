Dear Amy & the Team at \[Rentamotorcycle\],

Just want to say a big shout out to you and the team for making my 3 day rental an absolute breeze. From the timely response to my initial enquiry to the prearranged return on Sunday afternoon, everything was perfect.

Bike was as advised, a near new BMW F900 XR, complete with panniers all set up and ready to go when I arrived just before closing. Paperwork was effortless and all clearly explained. They clearly put the customer first and I'm already planning my trip for next year and hopefully, it will be for more than 3 days.

Dave from London.
