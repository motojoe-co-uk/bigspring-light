Yearly, three friends and I do what we call a “Quality Remaining Time” tour; mostly it’s been off-road in places like Alaska.

This year we chose Scotland and we were so happy we did. The team at rentamotorcycle.co.uk were brilliant. Great bikes, great (amazing 7 day route), hotels and food.

Simply wonderful service and support start to finish.

Thank you!
