Thanks for all your help with the rental of the R 1250 RT.

The whole experience was seamless. Collection from Kenny was excellent and return to Marcin was also excellent; both were very helpful.

The bike was great and I had no problems at all.

I attach a pic of the bike with a brooding Buchaille in the background.

Once again, thanks for all your help (and pass my thanks to Kenny and Marcin).
