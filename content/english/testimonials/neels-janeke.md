The bike was awesome. Handled extremely well and was an absolute pleasure to ride.

The accommodation was something special. We loved the mix of hotels and it is clear that the accommodation was not just picked from a map but had been experienced by your team before. Cudos!

The recommended route was the highlight of the trip. We would never have been able to find those tracks on our own. Loved the little info pointers like the Boathouse in Fort Augustus. The Bealach Na Ba was undoubtedly the highlight of the highlights.

A Bucket List trip that surpassed all expectations. One that will be remembered for all time. Thank you so very much!

Kind regards and hoping to see you again in the not too distant future.
