I rented a GS700 from you and had a magnificent 7 days in Scotland. 

I was so blown away and overwhelmed by the landscape, the country, the people – and since I almost exactly followed the route that you have suggested, I still owe you a big ‘thank you!’

So currently I am thinking of renting a bike from you again, to do a little 4-day-tour in August this year. This time I would book the whole tour with you (to be honest, some of the motels that I booked my self were adventerous, to say the least…).
