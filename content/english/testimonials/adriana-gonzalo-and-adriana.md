My parents and I recently went on a 5-day motorcycle tour around Scotland. 

It was a once in a lifetime experience, in which we had the chance to see some of the most beautiful landscapes we have ever seen, ride the motorcycle in single track roads with breath-taking views and visit beautiful castles and lakes. 

The tour was carefully thought planned by Amy from Rentamotorcycle and we are so grateful that we chose the company to help us in our adventure, because otherwise we wouldnâ€™t get such an amazing route with the best and most comfortable hotels included. 

The GPS was also carefully programmed with our routes, including near gas stations, which helped us a lot during the trip. Thank you everyone from Rentamotorcycle/Motorrad Edinburgh for all of the support and assistance and for helping us make the best out of the most amazing trip of our life!  
  
We sure will be coming back to you for new adventures.
