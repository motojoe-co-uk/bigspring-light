We had a great trip and thoroughly enjoyed Scotland and everyone we met. I used to work on the rigs in the north sea and passed through but was never able to tour. I have been wanting to get back for many years. Both Trish and I loved it.

The bike was good; very similar to one I own so I knew what I was getting into. It was well maintained and ran like I would expect it to. I dropped the bike when a pedestrian stepped in front of us. The bike is a little taller than mine and it was on an inclined corner. There was too much air under my boot and I couldn’t hold it up. Peter is an excellent ambassador and was great to work with. He worked a deal on the repairs that was fair for both of us. It was unfortunate but it happened. Lots of people and companies are easy to work with until there’s a problem. Peter and Joe were good to work with when there was one. Says a lot.

Thank you very much for all your assistance. The accommodations were excellent and we had good food (in a couple places exceptional) every place we went. Yes, we sampled plenty of scotch. I’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to meet you but perhaps we’ll come back. We didn’t get to see much of the northern part of the country.

Thank you very much again for helping make our trip a wonderful experience.
