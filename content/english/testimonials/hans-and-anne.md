I don‚Äôt have words enough to express how much we have enjoyed this trip. After every bend of the road my face shield got all foggy on the inside. Woaaah! And OMG!  
Extremely beautiful, dramatic and varied landscape. Excellent selection of hotels. Lovely, helpful, friendly, jolly people everywhere. Delicious food. Fantastic biking roads. We have had so much fun.

So, are we satisfied? Yes! Do we want to go back? Yes!

To summarize: as I already told you how awesome you guys are, I just want to suggest you are a bit more specific and detailed in the descriptions of the itineraries. Tags such as ‚Äúheights‚Äù would have made me avoid the trip to Applecross, as my wife is suffering from high anxiety. Also, I was really disappointed that you were not there to welcome us back Amy üòâ

Yes, I will definetely post some picture on your Facebook page. Thank‚Äôs for everything, and maybe we‚Äôll see each other next year again.
