I had a terrific time. Everything went according to plan. 

The food, service and accommodation was excellent. The scenery was spectacular and photos couldn’t do any of it justice. 

I met a whole lot of people and everyone was friendly and happy to get into a conversation. At first I had thought the distances each day may have been a bit short, but each day was a long one and just right. The bike was great too with the easiest of gear changes.

I’m on my way back to Melbourne today, and would do it all again for sure.

Thank-you for the many email exchanges to get dates and accommodation changed. I had a great time.

I’ve attached a photo of a Westie that the owners let me have a hold of…..my next dog for sure!
