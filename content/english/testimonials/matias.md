It has been one of the best travels in my life so far.

I am looking forward to come back and visit all the places I could not during the past six days.

All the staff at Dalkeith were great, 10 points. Specially taking into account that they were in their free day last Monday and came to receive me with a big smile and also gave me directions to get to my hotel.

No problem whatsoever with the bike.

All my friends back home are already planning to come to Scotland renting bikes too after me sending them lots of pictures.
