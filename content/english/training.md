          <p class="lead mb-3">You can get your full (category A) motorcycle licence using the direct access scheme (DAS) if
            you’re aged 24 or over. You’ll have to pass the motorcycle practical tests on a machine of at least 40 kW
            (53.6 bhp). </p>
          <p>Taking direct access means you’ll have a full motorcycle licence without previously holding a licence for a
            smaller bike for two years – you’ll have no restriction on the size of machine you can ride.</p>

          <p>The A2 Motorcycle licence is designed for people between 19 - 23 years old. The A2 licence follows the same
            structure as the DAS course with the test taken on a restricted bike, on reaching age 24 or after 2 years
            have passed, an A2 licence holder may upgrade to an unlimited licence by taking both practical tests on a
            full power bike.</p>
