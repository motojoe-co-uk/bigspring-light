            <p>A fantastic and rare opportunity to ride on some forest trails in Scotland for around 60 miles.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>Attendees must have off-road experience to participate. Try one of our Dirty Demos first, if you need experience and/or want a refresher.</p>

            <p>*No refunds given, unless we are able to find a replacement rider in time.</p>
