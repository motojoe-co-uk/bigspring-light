### The ultimate ‘must-see’ event for motorsport fans
Starting and ending in Edinburgh, the historic and beautiful capital of Scotland, we’ve compiled a trip that will enable you to be there for the Isle of Man’s world-famous TT.

The Isle of Man TT is the ultimate ‘must-see’ event for motorsport fans across the globe. Every year in May and June, the Isle of Man, a tiny country between England and Ireland, turns into motorcycle nirvana as the world’s greatest road racers gather to test themselves against the incredible ‘Mountain Course’, a 37.73 mile beast of a course carved out of the island’s public roads.

For over 100 years the Mountain’s siren call has drawn fans and riders to experience the unique atmosphere of the Isle of Man TT Festival and in 2022 we’re offering you the chance to be in the midst of the exciting action!

Why not take advantage of an epic journey over the mountain road when the full line is available with no speed limits.
