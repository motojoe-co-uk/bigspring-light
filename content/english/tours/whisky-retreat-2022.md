This is something just a tiny bit special. Maybe VERY special. A bit of an exclusive opportunity for those with an interest in Whisky.

It could only be described as the Whisky Lover's Dream Retreat.

Now we admit, this is slightly pricier than our ’normal’ tours but as you’ll see from the itinerary below, most of the pennies will be allocated to Uisge beatha or "Water of Life"

Join us for an exclusive 2 night / 3 day experience, like no other.

###### Only 6 spaces available.

##### Friday 2nd September

Depart Dalkeith for a ride to a newly renovated stunning house with a deep whisky heritage, nestled right in the heart of the Scottish Highlands.

Upon arrival you will be greeted by your host (and renowned whisky expert) with a welcome dram in the form of a whisky highball. This will be accompanied by light snacks.

Transport to the Dowans Hotel for a welcome drink at the bar before moving on to the Private Whisky Snug. Enjoy a 3 course whisky dinner paired with 4 local Speyside Whiskies. All hosted by our host & expert who will guide everyone through the whisky and how it is paired with each dish.

Transport back to the retreat.

##### Saturday 3rd September

Transport to the local Dowans Hotel for continental or cooked breakfast.

Transport to the Glenfiddich Distillery for a private tour, tasting and fill your own 20cl bottle experience (2 hours).

We then stay at the Glenfiddich Distillery for a 2 course lunch.

Then its a tour of the surrounding area including whisky tasting by our host along the way! This will be an insider look into some of Speyside's most famous sights and distilleries, for example, Macallan, Telford Bridge and the Cardhu Distillery.

Note: this will not include any tours of distilleries but simply looking at them from afar whilst having a dram from our host's secret stash of whisky.

Back to the house to relax & refresh.

Transport to the Highlander Restaurant in Craigellachie. Dinner will be 2 courses and include soft drinks and limited alcoholic drinks.

Transport back to the retreat.
