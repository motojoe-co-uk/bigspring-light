Touring Scotland by motorcycle is one of the world’s best motorcycle experiences.

Breathtaking scenery, glorious lochs and glens, dramatic coastlines and open roads make Scotland the motorcyclist’s dream.

#### Tour Overview

Our guided tour will provide you with a true taste of Scotland, avoiding the main ‘coach tour routes’ but including the most beautiful remote locations.

Our first day takes you north, tackling the highest roads in Scotland in the UK’s largest National Park, The Cairngorms, where we also stop for the night.

##### Monday 18th July

On day two we start the day with a ride to Loch Ness where we take part in a 60-minute fast boat ride to find Nessie! If anyone is going to track her down, we will, so hold tight and keep your eyes open – she’s there, somewhere! Then it’s on to Urquhart Castle before the route takes us over to Lairg and then the north on single track roads to Tongue.
