Join us for a 2 night / 3 day trip to what must be our favourite Inn in Scotland (perhaps because of the excellent food – not to mention the spectacular location!), whilst taking a day to enjoy and explore the beautiful Isle of Skye.

##### Friday 9th September

Leaving Dalkeith at 9:00 am on Saturday morning the first stop is at Kinross Services to fuel up and pick up anyone who wishes to join in from there.

Onwards, passing through Glendevon and Gleneagles to Crieff, for a quick stop at Glenturret Distillery.

From Crieff, through the Sma’ Glen (a passage from the Lowlands into the Highlands) and into Kenmore on the banks of Loch Tay, stopping there for a lunch break.

Continuing north through Tummel Bridge to Dalwhinnie (Dail Chuinnidh or "Meeting Place") - another chance for fuel and a quick break.

Head west along the A86 to Spean Bridge, past the Commando Monument with lovely views of Glen Garry and Ben Nevis and onwards to Shiel Bridge - the last opportunity of the day for fuel.

Last leg of the day is a quick run over The Ratagan Pass, a lovely road, climbing and twisting with views of the 5 Sisters of Kintail (one of the great ridge walks of Scotland) and on into Kirkton of Glenelg (famously twinned with Glenelg on Mars) where we stop for the evening.

##### Saturday 10th September

A quick ferry hop on the MV Glenachulish over to Isle of Skye (one of the last hand turned ferries remaining in the world (https://skyeferry.co.uk). If you are lucky, there is a chance to see Victor the Sea Eagle and other wildlife on the crossing.

Then it's a day to explore the beautiful Isle of Skye.

Options for the day include a visit to Talisker Distillery, Neist Point Lighthouse, Uig and The Quiraing, the Trotternish Ridge and Portree.

The exact itinerary will be decided by the group on the day and riders can either join the main group or explore on their own.

Then it's back over on the ferry, returning to Glenelg for the evening.

##### Sunday 11th September

A more leisurely start to the day, leaving Glenelg at 10:00 am, heading back over the Ratagan Pass to Shiel Bridge.

Heading south, at the Commando Monument, we turn off onto the B8004 towards Gairlochy and follow the road to Banavie, stopping at Neptune’s Staircase, a Thomas Telford engineering marvel of a set of stepped locks which allows boats to traverse a height of 70 feet above sea level in 500 yards.

Then it's through Fort William on the A82 to North Ballachulish.

A run through Glen Coe and Rannoch Moor, where the roads and scenery are fantastic with a stop in at the Green Welly at Tyndrum, before heading homeward.
