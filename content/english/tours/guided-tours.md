### A motorcyclist’s dream
The Scottish Highlands, steeped in history, is one of the last unspoilt regions of Europe. Breathtaking scenery, magnificent castles, amazing wildlife and those wonderful open roads.

Our guided tours take all the worry and hassle out of planning a tour.

We have picked our favourite roads, accommodation and highlights, rolled them all into our guided tour to make the most of your time in Scotland.

Our guided tours include all accommodation, breakfast each morning and dinner on six nights.

Full tour itinerary, notes and accommodation details, for each day, are provided.

The tour does not include motorcycle rental, fuel, ferry costs, lunches or entrance to any venues or attractions.

### 6 Day Tour Itinerary
Rider	£1,649
Rider & Pillion	£2,649

#### Saturday:
Arrival day.  However you arrive into Edinburgh, we can help organise to bring you to your city centre hotel for the evening. Saturday evening, at our meet and greet event, we will do as much preliminary paperwork as possible and answer any last minute questions, in an effort to make sure our tour gets off to prompt start the next morning.

#### Sunday:
Our tour starts from MotoJoe HQ, in Dalkeith.  You will be collected from your hotel. All rentals will be processed, fuelled and ready to go.  All we have to do is check over the bikes, load/pack and kit up, ready for the off. We aim to be leaving by 10:00 am. We head north over the Forth Road Bridge (perhaps on the new Queensferry Crossing), alongside the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the Forth Rail Bridge. Passing through the Ochil Hills and alongside the famous Gleneagles golf course, we head along Loch Earn and Loch Tay. Then it’s onwards to the Cairngorms National Park, the largest in the UK, on the lovely Roman Roads, over some of the highest roads in Scotland – on the infamous Cock Bridge to Tomintoul road (usually the first to close for snow) and past the Lecht and Glenshee Ski Centres.

Riding: 5 Hrs  –  220 miles

#### Monday:
We head off to Fort Augustus then run along the side of Loch Ness. Heading up to The Black Isle and up into the hills over the Dornoch Firth then northward for a run around the northwest coast.

We stop off to see Smoo Cave –“the largest and most dramatic coastline cave in Britain – once the refuge of Vikings. This spectacular site has a rich archaeological history, an interesting geological formation and is abundant in wildlife.” 

Continuing our run through the rugged and sparsely populated Sutherland area, we continue over the picturesque Kylesku bridge and onwards to Loch Assynt, for the evening.

Riding: 5 Hrs  –  250 miles

#### Tuesday:
Heading back south, we run down the west coast of Scotland, on arguably, the best roads Scotland has to offer,  alongside many lochs on the way to Applecross and over the Bealach Na Ba (Pass of the Cattle).

We continue southwards to Glenelg where we stop for the evening.

Riding: 4.5 Hrs  –  220 miles

#### Wednesday:
We loop around the breathtaking Isle of Skye, crossing from Glenelg to Skye on the Kylerhea Ferry – the last hand turned ferry in Scotland.

First stop is Dunvegan Castle, then round Skye’s northern peninsula, passing through the Trotternish landslip, a massive landslide that runs for 19 miles, taking in The Quiraing and The Old Man of Storr – all of which have featured in numerous films: Snow White and the Huntsman, The BFG, Prometheus, The Land that Time Forgot, 47 Ronin, Stardust, Breaking The Waves, Macbeth and many more.
“The rocky summits of the Cuillin are amongst the toughest mountains in the UK and are pure drama. Sometimes called Black Cuillin, it can be described as breathtaking yet unforgiving. It’s a range formed by 36 peaks stretching along 12 km of ridge, and is a firm favourite with serious climbers and Munro-baggers.” – www.visitscotland.com

Stopping in at Portree, we then down to Elgol, before returning to Glenelg for another evening.

Riding: 4 Hrs  –  180 miles

#### Thursday:
This penultimate day promises to be full of glens, mountains and lochs.  Tioram Castle, the Corran Ferry, Ballachulish Bridge and the rollercoaster Kinlochleven loop all feature in this run.

We return back around the Kinlochleven Loop to stop for the night in Ballachulish.

Riding: 5 Hrs  –  220 miles

#### Friday:
Our last day takes in the spectacular roads and vistas of Glencoe and Rannoch Moor. Then we head down to the new town of Inveraray, up over the “Rest and Be Thankful”, down the west side of Loch Lomond then through the Carron valley to stop at the engineering marvel that is the Falkirk Wheel.

Our tour draws to a close and it’s back to MotoJoe HQ, in Dalkeith.

Riding:  4 Hrs – 180 miles
