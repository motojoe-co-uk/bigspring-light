All the motorcycles in our rental bike selection are from the BMW Motorrad range. 

The majority of our fleet is under six months old and all are maintained to the highest standards in our fully equipped workshop.

Use our [Rental Calculator](/rental/rental-calculator) and check availability for your specific requirements.

Detailed specifications of the models available can be found on [Motorrad Central Scotlandâ€™s website](https://www.motorradcentral.com).

One question we are often asked is about the seat height of the bikes. The BMW Motorrad [seat height configurator](https://www.bmw-motorrad.co.uk/en/models/seat-height-overview.html) has all the details.

We also have some Low Suspension Models available. Just [ask us](/booking-enquiry) about availability.

The bikes come complete with side panniers (excluding bikes in the Sport and Urban Mobility Ranges) and, depending on the model, tank bags and top boxes may also be available (at no extra charge).

Garmin SatNavs are a chargeable option if you would like one fitted to the bike. Click [here](/rental/rental-prices) for our pricing and [here](/booking-enquiry) for more details on how to book.

Please make sure you have read our [terms](/terms/rental-terms) and our [insurance details](/terms/insurance-details).
