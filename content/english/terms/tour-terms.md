**4.** The balance of the tour price must be paid no later than eight weeks before the tour commencement date. If the balance of the tour price is not paid by the required date, Motorrad Group may cancel the tour and retain the deposit.

**5.** Cancellation by the customer will be subject to the following levels of refund:
    -- Within four weeks of the tour commencement date: no refund but Motorrad Group will use its reasonable endeavours to recover from its suppliers any payments made and will refund these to the customers as and when it receives them subject to an administration fee of £100;
    -- More than four weeks but less than eight weeks of the tour commencement date: 50% refund of the tour price;
    -- More than eight weeks but less than six months of the tour commencement date a refund of all amounts paid less the tour deposit which is subject to paragraph 3 above; and
    -- More than six months of the tour commencement date a full refund.
**6.** Once a tour has commenced, no refund will be made if the customer curtails the tour or, for any other reason, does not complete the tour.

**7.** The customer may request amendments to the tour and Motorrad Group will use its reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests and will inform the customer of any additional costs or other changes to the tour which are required. Any such costs will be paid by the customer before the commencement of the tour.

**8.** Motorrad Group will use its reasonable endeavours to ensure that the tour is provided in accordance with the tour proposal. Circumstances may occur which are beyond its control whereby this is not possible. Such circumstances may include (but are not limited to) war, the threat of war, civil unrest, industrial dispute, unavoidable technical issues with transport, closure of ports, airports or other transport infrastructure, terrorism, fire, volcanic activity, flood or other adverse weather and natural or nuclear disaster. In the event of the occurrence of such circumstances, no refund or compensation will be payable and the tour may be cancelled or curtailed. Customers will be responsible for their own costs including meals, accommodation and transportation.

**9.** Motorrad Group will not be liable for any personal injury, death or illness howsoever caused unless due to its gross negligence.

**12.** Motorrad Group and the customer accept that communications via email will be accepted by both parties as binding where agreement is indicated.

**13.** The United Kingdom has left the European Union.  There remain significant areas of uncertainty around the future relationship.  We can no longer guarantee that our motorcycles can be taken outside the United Kingdom.  This will be subject to the situation at the time, particularly with regard to insurance.
